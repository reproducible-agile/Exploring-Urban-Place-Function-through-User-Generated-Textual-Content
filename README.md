This study employs two datasets: OSM POIs and Wikipedia article summaries. The OSM dataset provides very short textual data in the form of tags, which essentially represent the category of what is located at that position. Wikipedia articles can vary quite substantially in their length and structure. Our analysis is limited to the summaries of geo-located Wikipedia pages, which are more homogenous while still providing key information about the represented object.
